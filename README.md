# stats.sobak.pl
This repository holds the source code for my tiny project, [stats.sobak.pl][link].
It's just a simple aggregation of few metrics for my profiles on various websites
showcasing my activity (or lack of thereof).

The original code dates back to 2014 and it wasn't really touched since then, except
for the bugfixes. You will not find PSR-2, PSR-4 nor Composer here but it works
nonetheless.
